"""Sedona Spark as a :class:`~sedonadb.testing.DBEngine`.

The compatibility target for SedonaDB's SQL surface is Sedona Spark, so parity
tests broadcast one shared SQL string to both engines and compare strictly —
the same pattern the geometry suite uses for SedonaDB vs PostGIS. This lives in
its own module because the engine needs pyspark, a JVM, and network access,
none of which the core :mod:`sedonadb.testing` module should pull in.

Bootstrapping a ``SparkSession`` (downloading the Sedona jars from Maven, JVM
startup) costs tens of seconds, which is why the tests that use this engine live
in their own suite under ``integration/spark-parity`` rather than in
``python/sedonadb/tests``. That suite is run deliberately and assumes the engine
is available, so construction failures here propagate rather than skipping.

Requires Spark 4.0+ (results travel out of the JVM through ``DataFrame.toArrow``,
which preserves nulls Arrow-natively — unlike ``toPandas``, which would coerce a
nodata ``None`` to ``NaN`` and mask exactly the value under test).

"""Cross-engine parity testing for raster (`RS_*`) functions.

The raster sibling of the `DBEngine` framework in `sedonadb.testing`.
Geometry parity broadcasts one SQL string to every engine; raster engines
cannot share SQL — rasterio is not a SQL engine, and raster SQL dialects
disagree on function names and argument order — so parity here is
operation-level instead: `RasterEngine` exposes one method per operation
(`clip()`, `value()`, ...) returning plain decoded values, and each
engine translates the operation into its own invocation.

Comparisons are asymmetric: `SedonaDB` is always the **subject** — the
engine whose behavior the tests exist to pin — and the other engines are
**comparators** it is checked against. `Rasterio` reconstructs each
operation from library primitives (where an operation has engine-specific
policy, like the fill outside a rasterized geometry, the reconstruction
resolves it to the subject's policy); `SedonaSpark` runs the Sedona Spark
SQL dialect, the compatibility target. Comparator↔comparator agreement is
never asserted. Where the subject and a comparator are known to disagree,
the test module declares a `Deviation`: the case still runs and is marked
as a strict expected failure, so the ledger entry itself fails the suite
the day the engines converge. Operations the subject does not implement
skip their module wholesale (`SedonaDB.implements`) until it does.

Test fixtures follow one pattern: define the raster once as a numpy array +
GDAL geotransform, write it to a GeoTIFF with `write_geotiff`, and hand the
same file to every engine. Fixtures stay CRS-less (no CRS on either side, so
nothing reprojects and results stay bit-comparable) except where an engine's
encoder requires a real one — then every side carries the same CRS.

    than the GeoTIFF writer's encoding of it. Geometry results travel as WKT.

    Sedona Spark treats a geometry without an SRID as EPSG:4326 and

    The window is `rasterio.features.geometry_window` (geometry bounds ∩
    raster extent, snapped outward to the grid), the selection is
    `rasterio.features.geometry_mask`, and pixels compose as "inside the
    geometry: source value verbatim; outside: `nodata`". This is deliberately
    not `rasterio.mask.mask`, which additionally reads the source masked and
    so remaps pixels *valued* at the band nodata to the output nodata — a
    policy Sedona (Spark and DB) does not follow.

    As a reference engine it takes no position on nodata precedence: `nodata`
    must be the already-resolved fill value, so `clip()` errors when it is
    None rather than guessing.

    One caveat on independence: both this engine and SedonaDB ultimately burn
    geometries with GDAL's rasterizer (rasterio bundles its own GDAL), so the
    pixel-center/all_touched selection rule itself is shared. The genuinely
    independent implementations under comparison are everything on top of the
    burn: window snapping, crop copy, transform shift, nodata handling, and
    band handling.

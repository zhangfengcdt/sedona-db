# sedonadb-geopandas

A GeoPandas-compatible API on top of [SedonaDB](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb/).

The goal is to let existing GeoPandas code run against SedonaDB's relational
engine with minimal changes, by providing `GeoDataFrame` / `GeoSeries` wrappers
whose methods mirror GeoPandas but delegate to SedonaDB expressions.

```python
import geopandas
import sedonadb_geopandas as sgpd

gdf = sgpd.from_geopandas(geopandas.read_file("cities.geojson"))
big = gdf[gdf["pop"] > 1_000_000]          # boolean-mask filter
buffered = gdf.geometry.buffer(0.5)        # element-wise .geo operation
web = gdf.to_crs("EPSG:3857")              # reproject (CRS tracked through)
result = web.to_geopandas()                # back to a real GeoDataFrame
```

## Intentional differences from GeoPandas

This is a compatibility layer over a lazy, relational engine, so it is
deliberately *not* identical to GeoPandas:

- **Lazy, not eager**: operations build a query; data materializes on
  `to_geopandas()` / `to_pandas()` / display.
- **No row index / alignment**: there is no pandas `Index`; joins and filters
  are positional/relational, not index-aligned.
- **Immutable under the hood**: "in-place" style operations return a new frame.
- **Plotting and arbitrary `apply`**: use the `to_geopandas()` escape hatch and
  operate on the materialized result.

See the SedonaDB "Migrating from GeoPandas" guide for the relational model that
underlies each method.

# Coordinate Reference Systems

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) describes how the numeric coordinates in a
geometry, geography, or raster relate to locations on the Earth. Two datasets
whose coordinates look similar are only comparable if they share a CRS, so
SedonaDB tracks a CRS alongside every spatial value and uses it to decide
whether an operation is well defined.

This page explains how SedonaDB *represents* a CRS, how it decides whether two
CRSes are *equal*, and what that means when you combine data from different
sources.

## The three forms of a CRS

A CRS definition attached to a spatial value can take one of three forms.
SedonaDB recognizes and stores whichever form you provide:

- **An authority code** — a compact `AUTHORITY:CODE` string such as
  `EPSG:4326`, `EPSG:3857`, `ESRI:102005`, or `OGC:CRS84`. This is the most
  common and most portable form. A bare numeric code like `4269` is accepted and
  interpreted as `EPSG:4269`.
- **PROJJSON** — a JSON object following the
  [PROJJSON schema](https://proj.org/en/stable/specifications/projjson.html).
  This is the fully self-describing form used when writing GeoParquet and
  Iceberg.
- **A WKT string** — a WKT1 or WKT2 CRS definition (`PROJCRS[...]`,
  `GEOGCRS[...]`, `PROJCS[...]`, and similar). This is the form most often found
  in GeoTIFF and other GDAL-sourced files.

You choose the form when you set a CRS (for example with `ST_SetCRS` /
`RS_SetCRS`), and files you read carry whichever form they were written with.

## The definition is preserved verbatim

SedonaDB does **not** rewrite a CRS you give it. Whatever form you supply is the
form stored and the form you get back:

```sql
-- Set as an authority code, read back as that same authority code
SELECT ST_CRS(ST_SetCRS(ST_Point(0.25, 0.25), 'EPSG:3857'));
-- => EPSG:3857
```

A WKT or PROJJSON definition is kept in full — SedonaDB will **not** collapse it
down to an embedded `AUTHORITY:CODE` even when one is present. Nothing is
discarded on the way in, so a consumer that wants the compact form can ask for
it, but one that needs the full definition still has it.

Internally there are two views of the stored definition:

- the **round-trippable / PROJ-consumable** form (what `ST_CRS` and `RS_CRS`
  return, and what is handed to PROJ at transform time), and
- the **field-metadata** form (what is embedded in GeoArrow / GeoParquet
  metadata).

Both preserve the original authority code, PROJJSON, or WKT as given. The
**only** canonicalization SedonaDB applies is for the longitude/latitude WGS84
aliases: `EPSG:4326` and `OGC:CRS84` describe the same datum but imply different
axis orders, so in the field-metadata form both are written as `OGC:CRS84` to
keep the axis order (longitude, latitude) explicit for downstream readers. More
generally, SedonaDB always assumes longitude, latitude axis order regardless of
what a CRS declares — many geographic CRSes, `EPSG:4326` included, officially
specify latitude first, but coordinates are longitude-first everywhere and
`ST_Transform` normalizes every transform to that order. The PROJ-consumable
form still returns the authority code exactly as you set it.

## Column-level and row-level CRS

For **vector** data — geometry and geography — a CRS can attach at two levels.
A **column-level** CRS is a property of the whole column: the column carries a
single CRS in its type (and, on disk, in its field metadata), and every value
in the column shares it.
This is the form `ST_CRS` and `ST_SRID` read, the form the equality rules below
compare, and the one `ST_SetCRS` sets.

A **row-level** CRS instead travels with each value, which carries its own CRS
rather than inheriting one from the column. Internally this is the value paired
with a per-row CRS string.

Most vector functions accept either form. For a row-level input, SedonaDB
applies the CRS rules per value: a function whose result does not depend on the
CRS (such as `ST_Area`) simply uses the geometry; a function taking two or more
geometries requires their CRSes to be compatible; and a function that returns a
geometry carries the CRS through to its result. The important difference from a
column-level CRS is *when* compatibility is enforced — a column-level mismatch
is caught at query-planning time (see below), whereas a row-level CRS is not
known until the data flows, so it is reconciled while the query runs.

**Rasters do not have a column-level CRS.** A raster carries its own CRS as part
of the raster value, so every raster in a column is self-describing; `RS_CRS` /
`RS_SRID` read the CRS from each raster and `RS_SetCRS` sets it on individual
rasters.

## Equality: how SedonaDB compares two CRSes

Deciding whether two CRSes are "the same" is the subtle part, and SedonaDB's
rule is deliberately simple and conservative:

- **If both CRSes expose an authority code, the authority codes are compared.**
  The issuing authority is treated as the source of truth about identity, so
  `EPSG:3857` equals `EPSG:3857` regardless of how each side was originally
  spelled. (The `EPSG:4326` / `OGC:CRS84` lon/lat pair is the one built-in
  alias that compares equal.)
- **Otherwise, SedonaDB falls back to a structural / string comparison** of the
  definitions — matching PROJJSON objects structurally, or comparing WKT strings
  directly.

This comparison is intentionally **lenient**: it can *false-negative* (report
two definitions as different when a full geodetic analysis would call them
equivalent), but it will never *false-positive* (it never claims two genuinely
different CRSes are the same). SedonaDB keeps the PROJ library out of the core
schema layer entirely, so there is no semantic-equivalence check here. This is a
different trade-off from, for example, GeoPandas, which compares CRSes through
PROJ using an approximate, confidence-based similarity threshold.

### What this means for you

**Vector** operations that require their inputs to share a CRS — spatial joins,
`ST_Intersects`, distance predicates, and so on — **raise an error on a
mismatch** rather than silently reprojecting one side to match the other.
Silently reprojecting geometry coordinates is exactly the kind of hidden,
easy-to-miss behavior that produces wrong answers, so SedonaDB refuses to guess:

```
Error during planning: Mismatched CRS arguments: epsg:3857 vs epsg:4326
Use ST_Transform() or ST_SetSRID() to ensure arguments are compatible.
```

To fix a mismatch, make the CRSes agree before the operation:

- If the coordinates are in different systems, reproject one side with
  `ST_Transform` (which actually moves the coordinates).
- If a value is simply *missing* a CRS, or is labeled incorrectly, attach the
  right one with `ST_SetCRS` / `ST_SetSRID` (metadata only — no coordinates
  change).

Because equality can false-negative, two definitions that *are* equivalent but
are spelled differently (say, an authority code on one side and an
authority-less WKT on the other) may be reported as mismatched. The fix is the
same: normalize both sides to the same definition with `ST_Transform` or
`ST_SetCRS`.

### `RS_Intersects` has different behaviour than `ST_Intersects`

A spatial join involving a raster tests the raster's **footprint** (the polygon
through its corners), not its pixels. When a raster is joined against a geometry,
SedonaDB reconciles the two CRSes as follows:

- **They share a CRS, or both are CRS-less** — the footprints are compared
  directly, with no reprojection.
- **Both have a CRS but they differ** — SedonaDB reprojects the raster's
  footprint into the geometry's CRS and the join proceeds, rather than erroring
  as the vector path would. Reprojecting a footprint is far cheaper and safer
  than resampling the pixel grid.
- **Only one side has a CRS** — this is an error, just as on the vector path:
  SedonaDB will not reproject into or out of an unknown frame.

The reprojected case is a close approximation rather than an exact boundary:
reprojection is sometimes non-linear, so the footprint's straight edges may bow
into curves in the target CRS, and reprojecting only the four corners can
under-cover the true extent. SedonaDB handles this by **densifying** each edge —
adding interior points in the raster's own CRS, where the edges are still
straight — then reprojecting all of them, so the reprojected footprint follows
the curve.

One performance note: an accelerated spatial join relies on a spatial index
built over a single, column-level CRS. A geometry or raster column that carries
a *row-level* CRS can't use that index, so the join falls back to a slower
nested loop join evaluation — prefer a column-level CRS for join-heavy work.

## SRID vs CRS

An **SRID** (Spatial Reference Identifier) is just the numeric-code view of a
CRS. `ST_SRID` / `RS_SRID` return the integer, and `ST_SetSRID` / `RS_SetSRID`
set a CRS from one. SedonaDB maps between the two following the majority of SRID usage in the wild: SRID `0`
means "no CRS", `4326` maps to `OGC:CRS84`, and any other value `N` maps to
`EPSG:N`. A CRS only has an SRID when it carries an EPSG (or lon/lat) authority
code; a purely custom WKT or PROJJSON definition with no authority has no SRID.

## Internals / design

A few deeper points, for the curious:

- **The core schema layer is PROJ-free and GDAL-free.** CRS representation,
  storage, and equality all live in the `sedona-schema` crate, which has no
  dependency on PROJ or GDAL. This keeps the low-level crate light and means
  equality never depends on a native geodetic library being present.
- **PROJ is used only at transform time.** Reprojection (`ST_Transform`) is
  performed by a pluggable CRS engine; the default is a PROJ-backed engine that
  lives in its own crate and is injected into the session. The stored CRS
  definition — including verbatim WKT — is handed to PROJ only when a transform
  actually runs.
- **A small in-crate WKT parser extracts identity without pulling in PROJ.** To
  read an authority code, SRID, or ellipsoid parameters out of a WKT definition
  (needed for equality and for spherical geography), `sedona-schema` uses a
  tiny, self-contained WKT-node parser rather than linking PROJ. It reads the
  authority only from the top-level `AUTHORITY[...]` / `ID[...]` tag, so a custom
  CRS is never misidentified by an authority tag buried on a nested unit or
  projection parameter. A WKT that is malformed or carries no top-level
  authority is still stored verbatim — it simply has no derived SRID.

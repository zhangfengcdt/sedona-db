# Zarr Extension (Python) API Reference

`sedonadb-zarr` reads [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) groups into the SedonaDB
raster type. Install it alongside SedonaDB, register the extension on your
connection, and read a group through its format spec:

```python
import sedona.db
import sedonadb_zarr

sd = sedona.db.connect()
sd.register(sedonadb_zarr.ZarrExtension())
sd.read("file:///path/to/foo.zarr").show()
```

Once the extension is registered, you can also query a Zarr group directly in
SQL by its URL, without an explicit format:

```python
sd.sql("SELECT * FROM 'path/to/foo.zarr'").show()
```

The URL must end in `.zarr`: SedonaDB routes it to the Zarr reader by that
extension, so a group at a path without the `.zarr` suffix falls back to the
default file listing (which fails on a Zarr directory). This URL-as-table
support is **experimental**.

For an end-to-end walkthrough, see
[Working with Zarr and NDArray data in SedonaDB](../working-with-zarr-ndarray-sedonadb.md).

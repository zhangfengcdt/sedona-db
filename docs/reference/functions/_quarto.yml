# This quarto project allows `quarto render` from this directory to be
# used such that it takes care of executing code blocks to create figures
# and render standardized frontmatter defining function arguments into
# usage/argument documentation.
project:
  title: "Function Reference"
format:
  gfm:
    # Increase the quality of the figures (the default of 72 is not very
    # appealing)
    fig-dpi: 300

# Use jupyter to render python code blocks. We could also use knitr, which
# is more flexible but requires an R install available.
engine: jupyter

# By default, don't echo the Python code for Python code blocks. We use these
# blocks primarily to create figures, not to demo Python code and its output.
# individual code blocks can add `#| echo: true` to override this default.
execute:
  echo: false

# These filters take care of rendering ```sql code blocks, rendering the
# standardized description/usage/arguments based on document frontmatter,
# and providing the function-listing shortcode used to list all the functions
# in index.qmd.
filters:
  - _extensions/render-meta-and-examples.lua
  - _extensions/function-listing

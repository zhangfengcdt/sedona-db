title: ST_Buffer
description: >
    Computes a geometry that represents all points whose distance from the input
    geometry is less than or equal to a specified distance.
kernels:
  - returns: geometry
    args:
    - geometry
    - name: distance
      type: float64
      description: Radius of the buffer
  - returns: geometry
    args:
    - geometry
    - name: distance
      type: float64
    - name: params
      type: utf8
      description: >
        Space-separated `key=value` parameters. Supported parameters include `quad_segs`,
        `endcap`, `join`, `mitre_limit`, and `side`. These parameters are identical to
        the PostGIS buffer parameter strings.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Buffer(
  ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((10 10, 11 10, 10 11, 10 10))'),
  1.0
) AS geom;
```

```{python}
import _matplotlib_defaults
import sedonadb

sd = sedonadb.connect()

sd.sql("""
SELECT ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((10 10, 11 10, 10 11, 10 10))') as geom
""").to_view("input")

df = sd.sql("SELECT *, ST_Buffer(geom, 1.0) AS result FROM input").to_pandas()

ax = df.geom.plot(alpha=0.5)
df.result.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red')
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Buffer(
  ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((10 10, 11 10, 10 11, 10 10))'),
  1.0,
  'quad_segs=2'
) AS geom;
```

```{python}
df = sd.sql("SELECT *, ST_Buffer(geom, 1.0, 'quad_segs=2') AS result FROM input").to_pandas()

ax = df.geom.plot(alpha=0.5)
df.result.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red')
```

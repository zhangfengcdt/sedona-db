## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Intersection(
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((1 1, 11 1, 11 11, 1 11, 1 1))'),
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))')
) AS val;
```

```{python}
import _matplotlib_defaults
import sedonadb

sd = sedonadb.connect()

sd.sql("""
SELECT
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((1 1, 11 1, 11 11, 1 11, 1 1))') as geom_a,
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))') as geom_b
""").to_view("input")

df = sd.sql("SELECT *, ST_Intersection(geom_a, geom_b) as result FROM input").to_pandas()

ax = df.geom_a.plot(alpha=0.5)
df.geom_b.plot(ax=ax, alpha=0.5)
df.result.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red')
```

SedonaDB is a high-performance, dependency-free geospatial compute engine designed for single-node processing, making it ideal for smaller datasets on local machines or cloud instances.

The initial `0.1` release supports a core set of vector operations, with comprehensive vector and raster computation capabilities planned for the near future.

## Key features

SedonaDB has several advantages:

* **Exceptional Performance:** Built in Rust to process massive geospatial datasets with exceptional speed.
* **Unified Geospatial Toolkit:** Access a comprehensive suite of functions for both vector and raster data in a single, powerful library.
* **Seamless Ecosystem Integration:** Built on Apache Arrow for smooth interoperability with popular data science libraries like GeoPandas, DuckDB, and Polars.
* **Flexible APIs:** Effortlessly switch between Python and SQL interfaces to match your preferred workflow and skill set.
* **Guaranteed CRS Propagation:** Automatically manages coordinate reference systems (CRS) to ensure spatial accuracy and prevent common errors.
* **Broad File Format Support:** Work with a wide range of both modern and legacy geospatial file formats like geoparquet.
* **Highly Extensible:** Easily customize and extend the library's functionality to meet your project's unique requirements.

## Run a query in SQL, Python, or Rust

SedonaDB offers a flexible query interface in SQL, Python, or Rust.

Engineered for speed, SedonaDB provides performant geospatial processing on a single machine. This makes it perfect for the rapid analysis of smaller datasets, whether you're working locally or on a cloud server. While the initial release focuses on core vector operations, a full suite of vector and raster computations is on the roadmap.

For massive, distributed workloads, you can leverage the power of SedonaSpark,
SedonaFlink, or SedonaSnow.

=== "SQL"

	```sql
	SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom
	```

=== "Python"

	```python
	import seonda.db

	sd = sedona.db.connect()
	sd.sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
	```

=== "Rust"

	```Rust
	use datafusion::prelude::*
	use sedona::context{SedonaContext, SedonaDataFrame};

	let ctx = SedonaContext::new_local_interactive().await?;
        let batches = ctx
            .sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
            .await?
            .show_sedona(&cts, None, Default::default())
            .await?;
	```

=== "R"

	```r
	library(sedonadb)

        sd_sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
	```

## Install SedonaDB

Here's how to install SedonaDB with various build tools:

=== "pip"

	```bash
	pip install "apache-sedona[db]"
	```

=== "R"

	```bash
	install.packages("sedonadb", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")
	```

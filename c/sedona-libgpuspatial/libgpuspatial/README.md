# libgpuspatial - A GPU-accelerated Geospatial Processing Library

***libgpuspatial*** currently supports the joining of large geospatial datasets using GPU acceleration.
It takes two inputs called "Build" and "Stream" from two ArrowArrays containing geometries in WKB format, 
where "Build" is a smaller dataset that can be fit into the device memory and is built into an index, 
and "Stream" can be a continuously incoming dataset that is streamed to find matches with the help of the index.
Currently, it supports the following geometries and join types:

Geometries:
- Point
- LineString
- Polygon
- MultiPoint
- MultiLineString
- MultiPolygon

For a given ArrowArray, a geometry type and its multiple variant can be co-existed in the same array. GeometryCollection has not been implemented yet.

***libgpuspatial*** supports the following spatial join types by computing DE-9IM (Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model) relations:

Spatial Join Types:
- Equals
- Disjoint
- Touches
- Contains
- Covers
- Intersects
- Within
- CoveredBy

## 1. Install depencencies

External dependencies:

- CUDA >= 12.0, Assuming you have CUDA installed.

- CMake >= 3.30.4

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.31.8/cmake-3.31.8-linux-x86_64.sh
bash cmake-3.31.8-linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=$HOME/.local --exclude-subdir --skip-license
```

- Arrow >= 20.0 (Optional, only needed if you want to build benchmarks)

```bash
wget "https://github.com/apache/arrow/releases/download/apache-arrow-20.0.0/apache-arrow-20.0.0.tar.gz"
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libzstd-dev # dependencies for S3 support and NanoArrow
tar zxvf apache-arrow-20.0.0.tar.gz
cd apache-arrow-20.0.0/cpp
mkdir build && cd build
INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/.local
cmake -DARROW_S3=ON \
	  -DARROW_PARQUET=ON \
	  -DARROW_IPC=ON \
	  -DARROW_FILESYSTEM=ON \
	  -DARROW_WITH_SNAPPY=ON \
	  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$INSTALL_PATH" \
	  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	  ..
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```



## 2. Build and install libgpuspatial

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/.local \
      -DGPUSPATIAL_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DGPUSPATIAL_BUILD_BENCHMARK=ON \
      ..
```

```cmake
# User's CMakeLists.txt

find_package(gpuspatial REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_app main.cpp)

# Link to gpuspatial
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE gpuspatial::gpuspatial)

# Pass the shader path to the C++/CUDA code
target_compile_definitions(my_app PRIVATE
    GPUSPATIAL_SHADER_PATH="${gpuspatial_SHADER_DIR}"
)
```

## 3. Run benchmarks


```bash
aws configure sso --use-device-code
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

```bash
./build/benchmark -build_file wherobots-benchmark-prod/data/3rdparty-bench/postal-codes-sorted \
                  -stream_file wherobots-benchmark-prod/data/3rdparty-bench/osm-nodes-large-sorted-corrected \
                  -execution geos \
                  -limit 5
```

"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for the scalar raster readers.

Unlike the geometry suite (which pins each engine against a fixed expected
value), these tests assert the two engines return the *same* result for the
*same* SQL over the *same* GeoTIFF — the parity question directly, with no
oracle. SedonaDB's own correctness is covered by the rasterio-oracle tests in
`test_rs_value.py`; this suite only asks whether Sedona Spark agrees.

Both engines are constructed directly rather than through fixtures: this suite is
only run deliberately, so a missing pyspark, JVM, or Sedona jar should be a
failure with a real traceback, not a skip. `SedonaSpark` caches its
`SparkSession` on the class, so building one per test reuses the same JVM.

Where the two engines are known to diverge and we intend to close the gap, mark
the case `xfail(reason=...)` so the suite doubles as a catalog of what to fix —
it flips to xpass the day the fix lands.

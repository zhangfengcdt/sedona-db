"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for raster-in / raster-out functions.

These exercise the raster round-trip *out* of each engine: SedonaDB decodes its
native raster column; Sedona Spark transports the result as GeoTIFF bytes
(`RS_AsGeoTiff`) and decodes it with rasterio. Both sides land as a
`DecodedRaster` (pixels + geotransform + per-band nodata) and are compared with
`assert_decoded_equal`. Same `xfail`-for-known-divergence policy as the scalar
suite.

Both engines are constructed directly rather than through fixtures: this suite is
only run deliberately, so a missing pyspark, JVM, or Sedona jar should be a
failure with a real traceback, not a skip. `SedonaSpark` caches its
`SparkSession` on the class, so building one per test reuses the same JVM.

`RS_SetBandNoDataValue` is the first case on purpose: it is raster-in/raster-out
but passes pixels through untouched, so a mismatch is a round-trip bug, not an
operation divergence — it isolates the transport. Pixel-transforming ops
(RS_Resample, RS_MapAlgebra) come next, with their known divergences as xfails.

# sedonadb

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sedonadb is to provide an R interface to [Apache SedonaDB](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb). SedonaDB provides a [DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org)-powered single-node engine with a wide range of spatial capabilities built in, including spatial SQL with high function coverage and GeoParquet IO.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sedonadb from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/sedona-db.git
cd sedona-db/r/sedonadb
R CMD INSTALL .
```

Installing a development version of sedonadb requires a [Rust compiler](https://rustup.rs) and a GEOS system dependency (e.g., `brew install geos` or `apt-get install libgeos-dev`). Install instructions for these dependencies on other platforms can be found on the [sf package homepage](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf).

## Example

You can use SedonaDB to read (Geo)Parquet files from anywhere. Filters are used
to reduce the amount of data downloaded based on GeoParquet and/or Parquet
metadata:

```{r example}
library(sedonadb)

url <- "https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow-data/releases/download/v0.2.0/microsoft-buildings_point_geo.parquet"
sd_read_parquet(url) |> sd_to_view("buildings", overwrite = TRUE)

filter <- "POLYGON ((-73.4341 44.0087, -73.4341 43.7981, -73.2531 43.7981, -73.2531 43.8889, -73.1531 43.8889, -73.1531 44.0087, -73.4341 44.0087))"

sd_sql(glue::glue("
  SELECT * FROM buildings
  WHERE ST_Intersects(ST_SetSRID(ST_GeomFromText('{filter}'), 4326), geometry)
")) |> sd_preview()
```

Conversion to and from sf are supported:

```{r}
library(sf)

nc <- sf::read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
nc |> sd_to_view("nc", overwrite = TRUE)

sd_sql("SELECT * FROM nc")
```

```{r}
sd_sql("SELECT ST_Buffer(geometry, 0.1) as geometry FROM nc") |>
  st_as_sf() |>
  plot()
```
